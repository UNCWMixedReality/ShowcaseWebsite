    <p style="color:black;font-family:Geneva;font-size:100%;line-height: 2;"> <strong> Virtual Access to STEM Careers (VASC) is a technology rich, inquiry and problem-based curriculum de-signed to expose and stimulate student interest in marine, environmental, computer, and geological sciences. Focused on grades three through five, VASC builds academic momentum at the intermediate level to pre-pare students for STEM opportunities later in middle school and high school.  Aligned to Next GenerationScience Standards  and Common Core State Standards, VASC immerses students in rigorous, high-interest learning modules where students are introduced and take on the roles and responsibilities of different STEM occupations.The proposed Virtual Access to STEM Careers (VASC) project entails developing and testing learning modules that synthesize cutting-edge virtual technologies and problem-based learning instructional practices to develop an innovative curriculum that:</strong></p>
    <p style="color:black;font-family:Geneva;text-align:left; font-size:90%;line-height: 2;"><strong>&#8226; Removes the traditional barriers (e.g., lack of school resources; geographic distance; poverty; disability) separating under-served students from participating in authentic STEM learning opportunities </strong></p>

    <p style="color:black;font-family:Geneva;text-align:left; font-size:90%; line-height: 2;"><strong>&#8226; Sparks interest in pursuing a STEM career in marine, environmental, geological, and computer sciences</strong> </p>
    <p style="color:black;font-family:Geneva;text-align:left; font-size:90%; line-height: 2;"><strong>&#8226; Embeds effective gamification and reward systems to increase and maintain motivation and focus</strong> </p>
    <p style="color:black;font-family:Geneva;text-align:left; font-size:90%; line-height: 2;"><strong>&#8226; Ensures students have the academic foundation to transition to STEM coursework at the middle school level</strong> </p>
    <p style="color:black;font-family:Geneva;text-align:left; font-size:90%; line-height: 2;"><strong>&#8226; Provides educators tools and professional development to effectively implement this innovative method of instruction.Partners of VASC will test and ameliorate the familiar challenges associated with instructional design and the use of virtual technologies to allow students to take on the roles and responsibilities of STEM occupations as they complete authentic, problem-based collaborative tasks set in immersive 3-D environments.</strong></p>
